# Tweet-Sentiment-Analyser
This App can analyse the sentiment of a tweet or a csv file with tweets

This project can serve as an efficient tool in Industry to identify and make predictions based on trends

I incorporated the use of various libraries to create a frontend, and backend code for my project along with designing a simple and attractive User Interface

What my app does is perform sentiment analysis using TextBlob and nltk,  to calculate sentiment percentages, and render a result with sentiment classification on the UI, made using tkinter

This process is initialised after the user inputs a tweet or a csv file in the text box on the UI and clicks the generate! button. The result is printed out in the Output box on the UI along with the probability
